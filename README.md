# SportsShop
A virtual sport products shop made with Java (no Database)

The idea for this program was to make a virtual sports shop that generates purchase receipts. By default there is a product stock with a quantity of twenty products; we can add new products to stock, or remove them. Products in stock can be ordered by its ID. The class PurchaseOrder generates the purchase orders by adding products to an ArrayList. Product objects are created with the Product class with a specific name, price, and ID. The class ShopTest in the package test shows how the program works, and generates the receipts.

Receipts generated by the class ShopTest are located in "generated_receipts" folder, inside project folder.
